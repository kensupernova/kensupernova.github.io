This is the entrance to my personal website in Chinese and English Version. 
I had learned this from <a href="http://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a>. As bilingual speaker, it is the best to establish website in two languages so that I can reach to more audiences. Currently I work as reseach assocate in Nanyang Technological University. Since I am so obssessed with coding, I learned to write programs by myself. I have taken more than ten MOOC courses on CS from Coursera, Edx and Udacity. They covered python programing, web appliation development, android app development, and data analysis skills.
