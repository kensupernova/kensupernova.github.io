This is the entrance to my personal website in Chinese and English Version. 
Great thanks to <a href="http://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a> from who I learned this and made this mainpage. As bilingual speaker, it is the best to establish website in two languages so that I can reach to more audiences.

Currently I work as reseach assocate in Nanyang Technological University. Since I am so obssessed with coding, I learned to write programs by myself. I have taken more than ten MOOC courses on CS from Coursera, Edx and Udacity. They covered python programing, web appliation development, android app development, and data analysis skills.

这是我的中英个人网站的入口。感谢<a href="http://yihui.name">Yihui Xie</a>，从他那里，我学到了做这个首页。做为一个熟练掌握了两门语言的人，建立一个双语的网站可以有更多的访问。

目前我在新加坡南洋理工大学做研究助理。对于编程，我有浓厚的兴趣，我自学了多门语言。从Coursera, Edx, Udacity等课程网站我修了十多门CS课程，涵盖python，网站开发，安卓应用开发，以及数据分析技能等。
