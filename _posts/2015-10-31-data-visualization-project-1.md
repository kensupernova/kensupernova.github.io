<p>D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3.js is an technology to create interactive data visualization. From my experience with d3js, it is really flexible to use. I created a visualization on a baseball player data sets and tried to explore whether the physical characteristics are related with their scores on the match field.
