<p>One thing I cannot deny definitely is that the year of 2014 is ending this soon. Being melancholy about how time flies is a cliche. Make a summary of what had happened in this year is more reasonable for a person like me who always can keep a degree of sanity. In order to avoid elaborating a boring list of events, I would try to add some excitements.</p>

<p>In the early two months I had a great winter vacation back at home. Since I still have HWG702-Teaching Assistant Class unfinished and more unexpectedly fail to get make up classes from lecturers, spending Chinese New Year with my parents made me have to quit the class so as to avoid a failure mark on my grades report. </p>
