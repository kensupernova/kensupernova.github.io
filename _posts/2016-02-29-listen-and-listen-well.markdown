Today I watched a very informative and educative video named ["How to be a better conversationalist"](https://youtu.be/H6n3iNh4XLI). In the video, the speaker gave a dozes of advice on how to make a better conversation when talking with people, among which the last one is to listen. This is not the first time when I heard people stressed the importance of listening. But none had mentioned the fundamental reason and objective behind listening. I totally agreed that quick reply was not the objective of erecting our ears and attentively receiving the sound waves others uttered from the mouth. We need to do so because we want to understand what people are saying. Listening consumes more energy than speaking because it requires our brain to finish these tasks, receiving the sound, interpreting the words, and processing the information of the sentences, etc. Listen, and Listen well.
